# PrimalityTesting

primality_tests.jl contains functions for trial division, Fermat primality, and Miller-Rabin primality tests.

PrimalityTestingDemo.ipynb demonstrates and compares the different tests.

This repo will likely not be updated further.
Thus this should NOT be used as a library for prime testing or generation. Use Primes.jl (https://juliapackages.com/p/primes) for such a purpose.
